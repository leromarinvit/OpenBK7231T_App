        "question": "How do I enable more logging? How to make more logs visible?",
        "answer": "First type 'loglevel x' in console, where x is 0 to 7, default value is 3 (log all up to info), value 4 will also log debug logs, and value 5 will include 'extradebug'. Then, on online panel, also switch filter to 'All' (both steps must be done for logs to show up)"

        "question": "How to set relay state on device boot? (PowerOnState)?",
        "answer": "There are two ways. <br> First way is to use Config -> Startup state and set it from GUI here. <br> Second way is to use short startup command from Options or create 'autoexec.bat' in LittleFS file system in web panel and execute commands from there.<br>For example, for RGBCW LED, to set 100% dimmer and red color on start, you can do startup command:<br> ```backlog led_dimmer 100; led_basecolor_rgb #FF0000; led_enableAll 1```<br>For simple relay, in this example on channel number 5, you can do:<br>```backlog SetChannel 5 1```<br>"
